# MVVM-Clock

This is a simple MVVM application.  

MVVM =>  View -> ViewModel -> Model

Model
ViewModel
View

Model = System State (No View in mind)

ViewModel = Translate System State to information for any View to use.  (Dynamic Views in mind.)

View = Visual appearance of any ViewModel information.



This simple application, at the moment, does not show commands or sending information from the View back to the Model (system).  Later it may but if you would like guidance on doing this the MVVM way I would be glad to assist.
